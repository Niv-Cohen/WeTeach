Hi there!
Here are some steps you need to go through in order to use the app:
1)after you cloned the app the a folder use npm install in the terminal
2)write 'ngrok http 3000' if ngrok is not installed 'npm install ngrok'
3)you will receive an http url-copy it and replace it with current url written in api/User.js
4)use command 'cd src/server' then npm run dev -if nodmon isnt intalled 'npm install nodemn'.
------it should say ---------------
 Running FirstRest on Port 3000
connected in to mongo instance 

5)in root folder of the project use command 'npm start' you should now be able to see the login screen.
